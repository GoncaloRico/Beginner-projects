# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple game where either player can be changed to be a computer making random choice, or a real player.

We can change these setting by changing the "x_player" and "o_player" at the bottom of the "game.py" file to be "HumanPlayer" for a real player, or "RandomComputerPlayer" for a computer.
